# Simple Story Template for Quick Prototyping

When creating user stories or feature descriptions for rapid prototyping, use this concise format:

## Core Story Structure
**As a** [user type]  
**I want** [specific action/capability]  
**So that** [clear value/outcome]

## Essential Details Only
- **Action**: One clear verb describing what happens
- **Input**: What the user provides (if any)
- **Output**: What the user gets back
- **Context**: When/where this happens (one sentence max)

## Writing Guidelines
- **NO filler words**: Remove "basically", "simply", "just", "obviously", "of course"
- **Active voice only**: "User clicks button" not "Button is clicked by user"
- **Specific verbs**: "Upload", "Filter", "Generate" not "Handle", "Manage", "Deal with"
- **Concrete nouns**: "Dashboard", "Report", "Form" not "Interface", "System", "Solution"
- **One sentence per point**: No complex compound sentences

## Quick Prototype Format
```
FEATURE: [2-3 word name]
USER: [Who uses it]
ACTION: [What they do - one verb]
RESULT: [What they get - concrete outcome]
```

## Example
❌ **Verbose**: "As a user, I would like to have the ability to easily and efficiently manage my personal profile information through an intuitive interface so that I can keep my data up-to-date."

✅ **Simple**: "As a user, I want to edit my profile so that my information stays current."

**Quick format**:
```
FEATURE: Profile Editor
USER: Registered user  
ACTION: Edit personal details
RESULT: Updated profile visible immediately
```
